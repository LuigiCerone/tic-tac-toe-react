# tic-tac-toe in React

It has been a long time since I last used React, this repo contains the code I wrote while reading the official [tic-tac-toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LuigiCerone/tic-tac-toe-react.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
